Revision history for Data::ObjectDriver

0.04_XX
    - Added has_a() construct to build linking methods between classes.
    - remove() returns number of affected rows, with DBI semantics.
    - Bulk inserting of data can now be done with the new bulk_insert()
      Class method.  It uses Postgres' COPY command or MySQL's 
      multi-value inserts to load data quickly.
    - The new() constructor for objects now accepts column name/value
      pairs which are passed to a new init() method.
    - The new init() method can be called on any object to set
      many parameters in one call.
    - This init() method can also be overridden, allowing for custom
      initialization code.

    - Added an inflate and deflate mechanism to memcached caching. When objects
      are stored in memcached, they are now deflated to a hash reference
      containing only the column values; retrieving the object from memcached
      automatically inflates the object to the full representation. Classes
      can override inflate and deflate to store additional information in the
      memcached representation that's kept automatically up-to-date.
    - Added a SimplePartition driver, which helps to make partitioning, well,
      simpler. Still to come: documentation and a tutorial on partitioning.
    - Many, many bug fixes and improvements to the caching drivers.
    - Added detection of changed columns, such that only columns that have
      been changed are updated in an UPDATE statement.
    - Added a clear_cache method to the D::O::D::Cache::RAM class.
    - Added cross-DBD error handling, which maps local error codes to error
      constants in Data::ObjectDriver::Errors. The list of supported errors
      is pretty miniscule thus far (just one), but will be expanded as needed.
    - Added support for query profiling (Data::ObjectDriver::Profiler), which
      counts queries, calculates frequent queries, and can produce reports.
    - Added support for optional table prefixes, which simplifies setting up
      identical schemas in the same database.
    - Added an optional $terms argument to D::O::D::DBI->update, which can
      add additional terms to the UPDATE statement besides just the PK.
    - Added a D::O::D::DBI->begin_work method, and improved the commit and
      rollback methods.
    - Added a D::O::D::DBI->last_error method.
    - Added support for multiple JOIN clauses with a new D::O::D::SQL->add_join
      method.
    - Multiple OR values are now contained in an IN (...) clause rather than
      many joined OR clauses.
    - Added a for_update option to search, which allows constructing a
      SELECT ... FOR UPDATE query.
    - D::O::D::BaseObject->column is now removed and replaced with a
      column_func method, which returns a subroutine reference used to
      initialize the dynamically-created methods for each column. This allows
      some optimizations.

    - Added Data::ObjectDriver::BaseView, a base class for creating "views"
      across multiple tables, or involving more complex aggregate queries.
    - Added trigger/callback support for common operations. See the
      Data::ObjectDriver documentation for more details.
    - Added GROUP BY support in Data::ObjectDriver::SQL.
    - Data::ObjectDriver::BaseCache->search now uses lookup_multi to do a
      very fast PK lookup, which will hit the cache first before the
      backend DB.
    - Fixed bugs with BLOB columns in SQLite driver.
    - Added connect_options option to Data::ObjectDriver::Driver::DBI, for
      passing in custom options for a DBI->connect call.
    - Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject->remove now works as a class method.
    - Added Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject->primary_key_tuple for retrieving
      the primary key value(s) for an object.
    - Added Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject->refresh to reload an object from
      the database.
    - Added support for HAVING clauses in Data::ObjectDriver::SQL. For views
      that are not attached to a particular datasource, any terms passed in
      to the query will automatically be turned into HAVING clauses.
    - Improved the lookup_multi method for all BaseCache subclasses: we now
      allow the subclass to look up multiple values in the cache and return
      any already-cached items, then make a list of the remaining IDs and
      send them to fallback->lookup_multi.
    - Driver::DBI->lookup_multi will now use an OR clause to look up
      multiple values in one query.
    - Added lots of test cases.
    - Pod fix (Thanks to Koichi Taniguchi)
